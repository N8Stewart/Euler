Common storage for all of my Euler solutions

# DISCLAIMER:
These puzzles are meant to be fun and challenging problems to solve individually before exploring online solutions. Please don't use my code to 'solve' the problems yourself. Feel free to look at my solutions if you are stuck or just want to compare your solution with someone else.

I could go into a length explanation, but it has already been done here: https://projecteuler.net/.
